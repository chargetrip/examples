Here you can find ready-to-run examples explaining how to work with the Chargetrip API. Each example has instructions in the corresponding README file. If something is not explained or you miss an example, please let us know by opening an issue. We improve our documentation continuously, and your feedback is valuable.

## Installation and local development

Install all the dependencies:

```
$ yarn
```

Run the application:

```
$ yarn dev
```

This command starts a local development server on `http://localhost:5000`. It will continually rebuild the application as your source files change. Note that there is no hot reloading.
