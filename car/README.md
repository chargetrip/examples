# Query all cars from our database

This tutorial covers how to get all cars from our database: 
 1. querying all cars using the Chargetrip GraphQL API; 
 2. Displaying information about the cars using a template.
 
To see this example live ðŸ‘‰ [demo](https://chargetrip.github.io/examples/car/).

### Technical stack

The Chargetrip API is built around GraphQL. If you're not familiar with GraphQL, [going over the specs](https://graphql.org/learn/) will be helpful. Don't worry, you don't need to be an expert to use this API, this getting started guide should be enough to get going.

To see our Chargetrip API in action, you can go to the [Playground](https://playground.chargetrip.com/). It has a big collection of mutations/queries for you to experience the power of our API.

This example is built with vanilla JS. To establish a connection with Chargetrip API, we use [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) - lightweight GraphQL client.
We use our Playground environment for this example. It means that only part of our extensive database is available. You need a registered `x-client-id` to access the full database.

### Preparation

Our Playground has a station database that is populated with freely available European station data from [OCM](https://openchargemap.org/site). Importing your own database or using one of the databases Chargetrip has an integration with, is possible. For more details, contact us.

The Playground gives you access to 4 cars. Some car parameters are courtesy of our partner [EV Database](https://ev-database.org/).


### Steps to take 

Once we have a car database, we can display the stations on the map: 

1.  We have to query a list of all cars. We can give the query paramaters of all the data that we want to request. You can read all the details about this query in our [Graph API documentation](https://docs.chargetrip.com/#getting-a-list-of-all-cars).        
2. With the car details we can show them in our template.
