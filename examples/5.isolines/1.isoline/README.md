# Display an isoline to show driving distance

Is the destination reachable with the current state of charge? Can an electric vehicle really go that far? Questions often heard. By using isolines, these questions don't go unanswered. Display the driving distance from a location on a map.

## Requirements

- [Chargetrip API key](https://account.chargetrip.com) - to plot routes outside this region
- [Mapbox API key](https://www.mapbox.com) - to display the map
- [URQL](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) - a lightweight graphQL client

## Steps to take

1. To display an isoline, a mutation and subscription are required. The `createIsoline` mutation will be used to define variables such as the `polygon_count` and location. In return an `id` will be created that can be used on the subscription.
2. The isoline subscription will provide status updates. Calculation of an isoline can take a little while depending on the `polygon_count`.
3. When the isoline is ready and the subscription returns status `done`, it can be plotted on the map.
