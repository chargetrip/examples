# Creat and display an isoline

This tutorial covers the basics of creating an isoline and showing how far a gien EV can travel:

1.  Create an isoline;
2.  show an isoline on the map;

### Technical stack

The Chargetrip API is built around GraphQL. If you're not familiar with GraphQL, [going over the specs](https://graphql.org/learn/) will be helpful. Don't worry, you don't need to be an expert to use this API, this getting started guide should be enough to get going.

To see our Chargetrip API in action, you can go to the [Playground](https://playground.chargetrip.com/). It has a big collection of mutations/queries for you to experience the power of our API.

This example is built with vanilla JS. To establish a connection with Chargetrip API, we use [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) - lightweight GraphQL client.
We use our Playground environment for this example. It means that only part of our extensive database is available. You need a registered `x-client-id` to access the full database.

### Preparation

To build an isoline, you will need a car (the associated consumption model of a vehicle will be applied to the isoline algorithm), and an origin.

For this example, we use **BMW i3s 94 Ah (2017 - 2018)** as the vehicle and **Frankfurt, Germany** as an origin.
Chargetrip operates an extensive database of EVs, each with their specific consumption models. You can find more information about our database and available queries by checking [Chargetrip API documentation](https://developers.chargetrip.com/API-Reference/Cars/introduction).

### Steps to take

Once we have selected a car and the amount of polygons, we can create an isoline:

1. To display an isoline, a mutation and subscription are required. The `createIsoline` mutation will be used to define variables such as the `polygon_count` and `location`. In return an `id` will be created that can be used on the subscription.
2. The `isoline` subscription will provide status updates. Calculation of an isoline can take a little while depending on the `polygon_count`.
3. When the isoline is ready, it can be plotted on the map.
